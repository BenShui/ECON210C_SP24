## Homework 1
Please check the pdf document for writing/figure solutions. 

I used MATLAB to complete this homework rather than python(since I prefer MATLAB to doing numerical analysis)

Please Check `hw1.m`.

I also wrote a Python code to solve this problem. But due to time limit, I only did it for a single $\nu$.
